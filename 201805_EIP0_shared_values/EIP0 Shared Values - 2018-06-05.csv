I think the aims and ideals of SRF are exemplary: http://www.yogananda-srf.org/Aims_and_Ideals.aspx, and some of them are general enough for any organization, e.g. ""To serve mankind as one’s larger Self.""","I saw and still see that there is a lot of potential with Ethereum to be useful, since it can be used for virtually any governance or economic activity, at lower transactions costs than traditional media of exchange. (I'm still here because there is still lots of potential.)

Money has not always existed, and we will not always continue to need it. When we get to a higher level of enlightenment/Self-Realization in civilization, people will be less needy and greedy. I should note that it is better to be practical. '“Forget the past,” Sri Yukteswar would console him. “The vanished lives of all men are dark with many shames. Human conduct is ever unreliable until anchored in the Divine. Everything in future will improve if you are making a spiritual effort now.”'","Generally, it is better to avoid being fearful.

 ","Originally it was the vision of autonomous contract coupled with the technical challenges. Reading the initial blog posts by Vitalik sparked my interest, but the actual low-level programming of the EVM got me hooked.

I'm still here because of
* The vision of automous contracts able to interact with real-world processes and people still exist
* The people: I work every day with people smarter than me, who are open, supportive and caring.
* The challenges: there's an immense amount of things still to build, and the range of things to dive into is astounding.

","Not a specific memory per se, but getting accepted into the Ethereum dev community, and later becoming one of the core-developers for geth ranks highly. I think they're totally awesome, and I started out auditing the EVM and learning Go in the process a couple of years ago, so would have never thought to reach that point.

Other than that, I've had a lot of Eureka-moments when finding bugs and flaws.

","The competition between Cpp/Geth, and later Parity/Geth is frustrating. To compete on the infrastructure-layer (protocols, test-networks etc) hampers the development process. We should not compete against eachother -- it's way too early. We have the entire world to take over. Why fight over a pond when there's an entire ocean to discover...

There are a lot of technical things that could've been done better, but I won't list all those.

The process for advancing Ethereum is frustrating, since it moves so slowly forward. I would personally like more to have a stronger leadership which could set the path and make a roadmap.

* Don't do anything I wouldn't want to take responsibility for if it became public.
* Real lives are the most important. If a bug can lead to someone committing suicide due to losing all his money, that's more critical than a bug (e.g. a consensus issue) that would annoy the entire ecosystem.

Blockchain tech enables for the first time to automate trust relationships in a completely new way without human trust parties involved. This is a major shift in power from monolithic controlling institutions to direct access to economical interaction without borders or restriction.","Ethereum was the first blockchain that makes non-monetary use cases possible, and spurred an innovation around new decentralised systems. I am fascinated by the community and the things being build, and the strong collaboration between all participants. It also created the largest developer community around blockchain out there and a mass of open source tools to benefit and accelerate everybody's ideas.","Launching the network and the way how it launched was a very fun moment, as it was very dynamically (self generation of the genesis block, miners jumped in, etc.). It all started with a nerdy group of people and took the world in a breeze.","The organisation structure about tools, projects could be improved. Im personally a bit frustrated by the attraction of ICO projects that have little to nothing todo with decentralised projects. While also the expectations for token evaluations is not in alignment with reality, as they don't compare to decentralised, or blockchain projects. Moving those projects to proper equity based token models would be a huge help here.","The focus on money and the price can be tiring at times. Also the mix of less knowledgeable parties and projects with no basic understand of the technology is annoying.","We need to better self regulate ICOs, and create incentive structures to
1. make ICOs more responsible for founders/investors (i.e. refundable ICO)
2. make token evaluations more clear, as they all seem to be mixed up right now

We also need to improve a lot on tooling, and best practices, as well as documentation. Here we are lacking the most behind, as everything happened so fast over the last years!","A person who understands and focuses on building a decentralised future that enables better and more fluid interactions between everybody.

Ethereum allows to iterate faster over incentive systems with real stakes in it. This allow us to test and improve economical constructs in an unforeseen fast pace, where in the past years of creating and establishing laws was required.
This is the core benefit ethereum brings, and will accelerate human interaction on a society and economical bases exponentially.","Ethereum can be used for good and bad.

Usability, usability, usability.

Being accessible, welcoming, and purpose agnostic: as far as I recall, one of the most explicit early goals for Ethereum was to be agnostic to the purpose it would be used for. This should imply no special logic as much as possible (or at the very least, special logic should be optional in all cases). ","At a high level: I wanted to be able to make fire-and-forget apps (logic on Ethereum, data on swarm, communications via whisper) which would ideally outlive me, or at least my attention. I'm still here because that's still mostly the case (although I have moved most of my development work to Dat-based projects), and Ethereum isn't an ecosystem of a single blockchain anyway. ","I have many fond memories of helping out with support for Swarm City, and testing various versions of their apps. This is an ongoing experience. ","We slipped up in preventing commercial talk on the /r/Ethereum subreddit, to the point where I stopped using reddit for my Ethereum-based information.

I found it extremely annoying that Skype was (and remains) one of the primary forms of group communication between members of the community. I felt pushed out by the community in the earlier days due to the closed nature of communications (the Ethereum.org forums [which I tried to be active on] and Skype) and eventually the cognitive overload led me to just leave and come back a few years later... where the same exact thing happened again with Slack. We need ways for people to communicate and give and receive feedback in low-noise environments, but this is clearly a Hard Problem. Also, why did it take so long to migrate to decentralized chatrooms? ","Noise, Moonkids. ","The way the DAO fork was handled might be considered a failure. At the very least, all major clients implemented both sides of the fork, so why was there a fragmentation of the community? I feel like there was (at the time, but now the communities are too different) a false dichotomy about what ""Ethereum"" is: the two forks didn't need to be considered different projects, and doing so set the negative precedent, not the fork itself.

Driving force behind ConsenSys, which is behind some of the highest quality projects in the space. Balanced outward demeanour, which grants credibility to the Ethereum ecosystem, and which contrasts nicely with the irrational cypherpunk fanaticism so prevalent in crypto.

Brian Armstrong
Coinbase is making a lot of great business decisions lately and is really driving Ethereum into the mainstream with Toshi/Cipher and 0x-based decentralized exchange. Brian's blog posts and Coinbase' overall communication also reveals that there is a strong mind and coherent vision underpinning these decisions, not merely short term economic incentive.

The combined whole of Ethereum developers and researchers in the Ethereum foundation, Parity and other valuable cornerstone projects like 0x, Maker, Digix, ... would be role model number three.","Too many to name. I don't think any one of them should take precedence over the other. Ethereum should not be driven by ideology. It should be an intentless world computer in so far as that is possible.","Pragmatism, rationality, objectivity, justice, equality, generality, inclusivity, nuance, ...","The abstraction from a discrete set of features to a general purpose, programmable blockchain seemed like a logical evolution. I'm still here because the rest of the world is starting to realize the potential as well, and synergetic, ground-up ecosystem growth is happening before our eyes.","Seeing my net worth increase significantly after investing in ETH, because not having to worry all too much about a constant inflow of money to maintain my lifestyle is very freeing.","- The website and overall documentation tends to be somewhat lacking. It doesn't hurt to display some impressive (but true) statistics on the front page for instance (amount of known dapps, link to the EEA, etc). The first thing newcomers tend to see is the official ethereum.org website after all. It's not so easy to see that Ethereum is the de facto dapp platform that underpins web3 right now.
- Core developer calls, governance meetings, and several other videos and live streams tend to be barely watchable due to terrible video and/or audio quality. Donating proper headsets to anybody that joins a core developer call would help perhaps. I noticed that it is improving lately though.
- Geth seems to be lagging behind Parity, yet is still the majority client. Too many people report inability to sync a full node with Geth. Without incentive to run a full node, at least the process should be as smooth as possible.
- WASM should get higher priority. The sooner the EVM can be retired, the better.
- Perhaps sometimes a bit too much leniency towards considering to introduce subjectivity in Ethereum's governance, particularly with regards to the Parity recovery proposals. Hopefully EIP0 manages to produce something that can serve as a starting agreement position for such discussions in the future.","The answer to that question depends on who should be considered part of the community. ICO scammers and opportunists are pretty high on the list I'd say. In the broader crypto community, Ethereum naysayers that purposely try to create a false narrative because Ethereum is not their tribe, endangers their net worth and/or belief system are high on the list.","See earlier answers.","Shares the values from previous answers, skilled in one or more areas that help the ecosystem, apolitical, level-headed, hung like a mule, a good sense of humor.","See previous answers.

He is also just so approachable, caring, and engaged, so any interaction with him leaves me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.

Economic Inclusion - unbank everyone!

Open Access - make all the data free! It's not IP or even data that is ""defensible"" anymore (to use shitty VC language), it is governance itself.

Connection - peer-to-peer systems are about building technologies that allow us to LIVE with each other in more constructive and mutually beneficial ways. Getting this right is incredibly important.","The promise of systems that could actually deliver on Bitcoin's promise of peer-to-peer electronic payment systems that everyone with an internet connection can use, understand and leverage for the benefit of themselves and their communities (i.e. it makes anti-rival goods and the production thereof a real possibility for all of us).

The notion of being able to read data from the chain in an essentially perfect way (deterministic and agreed upon by a global set of peers) means we can institute, at the level of the linguistic protocols we use to organise society, more open, transparent and equitable systems. This is a dream worth living and dying for.","A drink and a walk to dinner through Bangkok with Jarrad Hope (who I also would have listed in the first question had he not sent me this form) where we got to really understand what drives and inspires the other and where I was able to understand a lot more about the person behind the vision.

This kind of personal connection with the people driving forward the next web is what I live for, and Jarrad is by far one of the most interesting person to have these kind of discussions with.","Lots of the developer tooling sucks - which is why I have been driving ETHPrize and all the developer interviews so much.

I also get frustrated that everyone is in such a rush to ""change the world"" rather than thinking clearly and critically about what that really means and how it applies to the compromises they are making for the sake of convenience, or just to ship early. We are far too prone to rhetoric over running code, and this tends to attract people like those hanging around blockchain week in NYC recently.","Repetitive questions can get tough to handle after a while.

Explaining to people (especially speculative token investors) that good things take time to build when you are not willing to compromise on the key principles listed above also gets tiring.

Trying to collaborate with people who have very different opinions and approaches can be both invigorating and exhausting - better governance frameworks that allow people with very different approaches to work together on common problems while solving their unique use cases are definitely needed.","We're failing hard at documentation and therefore missing a lot of opportunities to attract more talented contributors.

The various different scaling initiatives are taking a long time and it is difficult to understand what sort of effect both Layer 1 and 2 stuff will have on both developer and user experience. I have yet to see any serious considerations of what happens when devs need to figure out which shard to inject their contract into, or what provider to use when connecting to a Plasma chain etc.","One who actively participates and doesn't let the feeling of inadequacy we all inevitably face when meeting people at the core of the ecosystem get in the way of adding their unique perspectives and talents to the community.
This person does first and asks permission never. They take ownership of an aspect that they have critically identified as one in which they can add real value according to their skill set.
They realise that not everyone has to be a coder and that we desperately need UXR people, PMs, technical writers, designers, and a whole slough of other kinds of people, all of whom - were they willing to just run with something themselves and see where it leads - can advance the common causes we are all passionate about.
basically, they are not afraid to fail and just want to help in whichever way they can because they are intrinsically motivated to see this stuff exist in the world.","Love hard. Love it all with everything you have and everything you are.

I fear we won't be able to find good enough governance systems before Ethereum or something like it really goes mainstream and that the culture and ethos we have developed will become diluted.
I fear the compromises we will have to make to ensure we can scale the current systems to meet global demand.","Being alive is THE super power. Life itself is the only thing commensurate with humankind's capacity for wonder - coming to this simple realisation at an experiential level is the root of all meaning for me.

It's true, what you told me,
all that time ago and right now:

I need to feel how you love,
how it is your heart holds together
this infinity,
how you give it back
when it comes due;
let it go
as if that had been the trick
to making meaning of the beat,
to feeling compassion like blood
returned on a tide
that tells of ten thousand things
never to be known.

And we, people of the sky,
who came here on a flight of birds,
or riding rain animals like
those old keepers of the kumm,
standing on another edge
and holding the world together
with a few simple words
about what it felt like
to give up, feel
the Earth itself move through you
and explode.

Then fear, and tears,
a hundred lifetimes of surrender,
before grace and gratitude:

enough
to feel how you love.","You've dreamed a world way beyond
what can be said.

A world with her,
and three lines of old French
stretching far into the spring sunset
which slides on forever;
finds you searching for breath
halfway up a mountain,
the padded silence of pine trees
suggesting a scene from long ago,
lost in the mist now rolling in
and the stray valleys of snow
clinging on to coldness
before this spreading life.

And at the top, two old birds,
an eagle and an owl,
carved lovingly into the fallen
trees, like shattered echo chambers
letting loose an old sound,
something you have heard
but since forgotten, something
like the snow and the spring
the the nonexistent boundary
between them...

Both lifelike and limited,
those two great birds watch
from fixed wooden eyes,
waiting for another dreamer
to wonder past and wake them,
will them up
into their native element,
no more to grieve, dear heart,
nor fear the seeming-

The open-source movement is relevant to a whole new level.","Humility, openness, transparency.","I was into Bitcoin. I didn't get Ethereum at first, too abstract. I was overwhelmed with information already so I consciously decided to ignore Ethereum. Until I find out about web3.  Then I materialized everything that could be done. All the socio-economic systems redesigned, decentralized.
The next 'aha!' moment was when I did the first prototype and I realized how 'easy' was to move money around, without any external service.  As a developer was a very eye-opening experience. I now could think about  very complex systems without any external dependency.

I'm developing with Ethereum because it pays the bills and it's very complementary to my other interest.
But, I believe trust based networks around the individual (not a piece of information in the blockchain) are a fundamental missing piece. Mostly because they resemble the analog world. Proper reputation systems are not only decentralized but distributed. In this sense I personally value more technologies such as IPFS or the libp2p stack.
","More that a memory... the energy of the community. The minds of some of its members.","ICOs and abundance in general incentivize building platforms from the top down instead of the bottom up. They need to deliver a promise in a paper, and they have all the money, no need to find out the real needs.
Big percentage of projects in the space (not only scammy ICOs) don't have 'real' users ,  and they're building for hypothetical use-cases. And the few users they have have a huge vested interest. This creates the illusion that value is created, when is not. This will end up back-shooting the whole community.","We're explorers. I perceive a little too much certainty about the future.
ICOs.","We have failed communicating the value of Ethereum. The currency part has devoured what I believe is the real proposition.","I don't think there is any other movement that embraces decentralization like Ethereum does (including other cryptos).
Do you want to decentralize? This is your place.","Optimize for personal growth. Avoid comfort. Humility, antifragiilty, sustainability, self sufficiency,  transparency.","The dilution of the nation-states.
A world were the benefits go to who creates value not who controls the channels.
A world not driven by economical incentives but by global needs.","Short term: Noise. Value of the Ethereum project perceived as the value of the currency.

Long term: The people that first got into Etherum , were some of the best minds, very ideologically driven. Big percentage of these people are now economically independent. The incentive to keep working hard is therefore much smaller.
The people joining now is much more driven by the currency aspect of it.
Is the cool innovation gone?
Other cryptos may become more innovative and may end up winning the long run?","I don't believe I have a purpose. I do have a monkey mind that wants to keep me alive.  This monkey mind is happy when it evolves and when it sees other's happy.

Thus, we should strive to make sure that that shared history is one all of humanity wants to tell in the future.","I was a developer trying to make Bitcoin do interesting things, wanting to experiment with how we can create more value for the many.

I had ideas about the way the world was going to change, and it's not there yet. I'm still here because we aren't done yet.

I think that section is worth reading, but the tl;dr is that I think there are two ""root"" values: Decentralization and Transparency.

2. For ""does"", I think Ethereum currently has the values: quirkiness/creativity, humility, curiosity.

I'm very tempted to have those values be part of the ""ETH package"", but I don't know if they should be mandated.","The ability for Ethereum to: decentralize power and create an antifragile system. AND the group of smart, well-intentioned people who are working towards that future.

2. Maybe something connected to ICOs? How could we have ""self-regulated"" them better?

"2018/05/27 4:01:56 AM GMT+2","I'm very friendly with Dmitry and Maia Buterin, aside from the fact that they nurtured Vitalik...they're both amazingly inspirational in the way they choose to learn, live and embrace living, and they share their journey publicly and openly.

Jordi Baylina, is committed to solving critical issues that hinder overall growth of the network and he's also among the most humble and moral humans in this space. I'm grateful to have spent time getting to see him work and listen to him talk. He's an honest hacker and here to oversee and protect the blockchain sphere. He's also a spectacular hugger ♡

Omar Bahm has been reporting on everything blockchain since I entered this space in late 2015, and he's very knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy. Everything changes so fast in this space that it's hard to keep up without someone like him. He also has never sold out for money, this is a very important purposeful choice on his part because he receives offers daily. He will only voice support of projects he truly believes in. I'm grateful for everything I've learned from him. Honest and opinionated, and down to earth.

Griff Green is also another guy who has been loyal and represented the best part of humanity within this ecosystem. I've watched him explore, grow, and accept the challenges that come with building tools to change the world.  He is always smiling and will give stop everything to give a meaningful hug or massage the tensions outta your back.

Taylor Monahan, I fucking love her ♡!! She was the very first lady that I saw in Ethereum. I noticed her because she was so passionate about helping others learn. She was handling support issues and under constant pressure, but she never doesn't show up. She is here around the clock and I know this because I am too. I see her commitment to creating change. She is vocal and fearless when exploring these uncharted territories that we've all chosen to inhabit together.

I'm tempted to just continue answering this question alone...I could go on forever here, I love everyone!

The Ethereum community builders have a few things in common: smart, committed to creating change, visionary, givers, believers, that contribute to the greater good of humanity. No matter what lead each of us here, we're here and we choose to contribute. We all NEED and deserve FREEDOM from the invisible chains. ","If by ""loosely related to"" you accept building on the Ethereum blockchain. I'll have to mention my baby first, Swarm City, we are passionately building a platform to connect our peers who want to transact freely. We're creating tools for users to build their own decentralized marketplaces, so that freedom can become a reality for anyone. We're exposing regular people to blockchain. We started as a group of activists and entrepreneurs, we've organically grown over the past 3 years, our struggle has been real, but we are stronger than ever and heading for our version 2 Boardwalk release <-- shameless plug ♡

MyCrypto provides an integral service and their community builders have bridged many of the  gaps between users and other existing projects, like etherscan and shapeshift, etc. Any new crypto user could visit the MyCrypto support link and learn everything they need to know about how to safely purchase, trade, and store tokens.

The Giveth, Aragon, Status teams have all worked hard to solve many issues that exceed the scope of their own project's mission into creating governance models, solving scaling issues, and building stronger communities...the mission statements and ideologies of all the above named projects are similar and pure.

The best of the best people are involved in Ethereum. ","Freedom, choice, decentralization, transparency, autonomous, knowledge, organic growth, meaningful work, stability, reputation, security, community

Because it's the right thing to do","At the beginning of 2014, I quit my job with no plan. My life and my perspective on living abruptly shifted when my 16 year old daughter passed away in February 2012.

I managed to survive on autopilot, showing up for work, breathing, and sleeping, until one day I woke up focused on the fact that I wasn't born to merely exist...I was desperate and broken and I asked the universe to set me on my path to fulfilling my purpose in life.

Shortly thereafter, I saw an ad about a rideshare app launching in my area and I applied for it. I got accepted and was tasked to launch Lyft and Uber in Louisville. I enjoyed the freedom of setting my own hours, meeting new people, and seeing the stars as the view from my office. I felt okay. I needed that in my life. I also noticed a few problematic areas that prevented this business model from being ideal for the drivers and I started looking for ways to solve it. One of the biggest problems was the interference of the corporation and the regulators into the peer 2 peer transactions. They restricting drivers to the point that there's barely any earning potential. The business model is designed to benefit the corp and they're just plain greedy.

I became an activist of sorts and an educator, and in my quest for freedom I stumbled upon Ethereum. It was under $7 per token, which meant nothing to me at the time. But I hyperstudied for at least 2 weeks and came out with a new outlook on everything. My mind was blown.

A few months in... the DAO project happened. I owned about $100 worth of bitcoin that I bought in 2016 for my birthday and mother's day. I fumbled to trade my bitcoin for ether to invest in the DAO because I was a crypto virgin up until that point. Great times ♡

The project I was working on was gaining momentum...so I found ethereum on the path towards fulfilling my purpose. And I'm eternally grateful, this is my world now. I support myself and my family from 100% crypto. I am free and I'm committed to sharing it with anyone who will listen.

Obviously...I'm here writing you a novel. ","My happiest memory related to Ethereum would have to be seeing Swarm City presented at Devcon 3!! It was an absolute dream come true for me. Not only did we present on the big stage, but I also met Dmitry in person for the first time at this conference. It went like this...I was by myself on the escalator going up when I looked up and saw him on the opposite escalator going down. I immediately shouted,  hey Dmitry, and started running down the up... I wasn't sure if he would recognize me or not, but I hugged him anyways and as it turned out he addressed me like a friend and addressed me by name! Just whoa! I had worked with him previously and had calls with him, but this was real life. This was no small detail to me... it was a moment of truth. It felt really good to be acknowledged and accepted into the Ethereum community.

But recently at the Edcon conference, I got to awkwardly meet Vitalik as well but only because I approached him stalker style from behind while he was busy chatting it up with a few guys, and I touched his right arm!! I was looking directly at his arm and petting him... like a cat or something... haha!! He paused and tilted his down and my way, no facial expression or words came from him. I introduced myself, told him thank you and walked away 100% fulfilled!!
","Thanks, just keep up the hard work. It's very much appreciated!! ","Scammers and ICO craze","","Anyone who contributes without the  need for greed","I'm just me ♡

I see and feel truths","Decentralize Everything... we're not tearing down what already exists but we're building something better along side it. "," I'm worried that as things become more mainstream that more and more greedy bad actors will invade the blockchain space, and it'll be harder for people to find out what it's really all about.

I think some people see bitcoin and crypto as a get rich quick scheme, but it's not about money here. It never should be. Only those who suffer from the systematically ingrained scarcity mindset are focused on that aspect.

I think greed will always be the thing that effectively divides the community...I think it's the obvious way to differentiate  ","Love ♡... it's the only piece of me that will I'll carry with me outside of this lifetime.

Love is pure. Love is free. Love is meant to be shared. Love can change everything in the blink of an eye.

Love is Magic ♡","Thank you for taking the time to survey the community. I'm happy to contribute my insight. I'm interested in seeing what you're","Jenn Williams ♡"

The Ethereum community is massive, there are probably hundreds or thousands of role-models and awesome individuals.","Egalitarianism. Antiestablishmentarianism.
Innovation. Openness. Transparency. Disruption. Collaboration.","Ambition. Respect. Honesty.

Ethereum need not limit itself - not for world leaders or for fear over abuse of its platform. Technology can/will always be used and misused. Ethereum offers too much promise to bow to the existing power structures of the world or the misunderstanding of the older generations usually in charge. They will feel threatened by an intrinsically useful asset capable of acting as currency. We should keep building. Replace what is broken.

Respect the thoughts and ideas of everyone enough to safeguard them all on chain. Respect future generations enough to start redistributing opportunities and global wealth that's currently locked in fait currencies building walls to protect incumbents and slow competition.

Be honest about what we think we can do and in what time frame. Be honest about the new issues the world will have to deal with if we are successful.","The things that could be built on top of it. The potential to disrupt existing internet behemoths and incumbents across industries. The responsive involved development community.

In some ways Ethereum is a social movement with a native stateless currency. Everyone can participate. The slate wasn't empty - but the founding ideals seemed basically egalitarian and promising overall.

I'm still here because decentralization matters - it's probably (currently) the best shot we have to make the world a much better place in a relatively short amount of time. The Ethereum community is determined to innovate scaling without compromising decentralization. That's worth contributing to. That' worth being involved in.","When I was investigating a dApp and used etherscan to analyze the transactions. The openness hits home when you have questions about how something works or what's going behind the scenes. Being able to explore, even in a rudimentary way, is powerful and very eye opening.","UX - it's hard to get people to *use* the platform. Some of this is just because the concept is so new. We need native OS support for blockchain identities. We need a way to delegate accounts or have children accounts so that lost accounts could be recovered. New users are clumsy and the cost is high right now. It discourages people.","Being worried about the next ""Ethereum killer"" - but that's generally in the trading part of the community. Tribalism - when Ethereum fans hate competition. Money is involved, people get a little radical.

At the end of the day there is an old way of doing things and a new way. Life before and after blockchains and public world wide computing platforms. Enemies of our enemies ... and all that jazz.

Let's not get distracted from fixing the world. Anyone trying to do that is on the same team.","Funding understandable documentation and educational projects. This space is confusing for so many people - there are lots of community projects popping up to educate people, but we need to people to be focused on this full time.

I may be slightly biased, but I think this work is just as almost as important as developing the platform. People need to know about it, what to expect from it, how to use it --- AND WHY IT MATTERS. Or we're going to have a handful of people being in the know - and the rest of the world getting conned and thinking the legit stuff is a scam.

The Ethereum foundation needs writers, animators, videographers - all with access to the developers - to makes this stuff digestible. Get passionate people to educate, educate, educate.

P.S.
 If this happens, I want to be there. Will devote my life to that kind of work.","A good community member is constantly learning. The breadth of the space is so vast - and the complexity can run so deep - there is never a shortage of things to learn. We need breadth and depth experts. We need explanations of the forest and the trees. Debate. Argue. Think. And then teach.","When you see something that matters, get involved. If you can help someone, do so. If you can teach someone - even better.

The current system is broken. Get yourself in a position where you can have a reasonable chance at making a difference without losing your soul.","One where open data will strip power from closed companies. People will use blockchains to verify myriad facts and events. Timestamps/block numbers/signatures will all matter. People will slowly begin to wrap their heads around them.

Collaboration will lead to greater network effect advantages for those choosing to build products and services collaboratively rather than in a traditional business model. Disruption everywhere. Less need for skyscrapers. More people at home. More gigs - less rent seeking.

Blockchain technology has a duality to it. In order for the blockchain to enable long term, positive change, it must retain properties of immutability, censorship resistance and decentralization.

Don't get me wrong – this opens a lot of doors to bring more investment in to the ecosystem, but I do think there is a sense that outsiders may think that the technology is more production hardened than it actually is.

I also think that some of the technical design decisions don't necessarily take into account end user experience very much. In August 2015 the community actually believed that it would be ""one user, one blockchain"" – as if end users would actually be running a geth node in the background to access their dapps. Thinking of this now, it seems pretty naive, but back then it was a prevalent thought. ","Someone who likes to build, who doesn't accept the status quo of where we are now.

I don't think this is true of all humanity, or all of human societies. But a lot of negativity exists in this world. How we can use this tech to make the world a better place is something that we should always be mindful of. Of course, the road to hell is paved with good intentions and so it's a delicate balance.","Human experiences. I'm a technologist.

","Humility. Willing to give up something good now for something better later -- not short sighted, future focused. Building what should be, not just what could be. What ""should be"" isn't determined by what's best for few ""disadvantaged"" people in the short run but what's best for all people in the long run. Holds people accountable. Not self-serving. Has the courage to tell stakeholders the truth, not just what the want to hear. ","The opportunity to learn and build on it as an open souce project.

Through a lot of study, I've actually been fortunate enough to land a job a solidity dev now -- working alongside much smarter solidity devs that I continue to learn from. But one of the happiest memories I have is from explaining Ethereum to my dad and seeing him light up with the same enthusiasm and excitement that I had in the power Ethereum has to change the world for good. My dad's built a strong business over the course of thirty plus years -- he broke off from his previous company in light of some ethical issues (and ambition of course, to be fair). Even as a cancer patient (now cancer survivor), I saw him actively participate in work, not resentfully because he felt like he had to, but because he wanted to and truly loves what he does and what he's helped to build and the people in it.  Ethereum's full of brilliant people, but I'd still have to say having that validation from him was better than any other I can think of. ","It's hard to be frustrated when I see things being actively improved and worked on. Frustration is not the right word -- I just see that there's more opportunity to pick up in some arenas. If I have to pick one instance that I wasn't fond of, it was the April Fools 'joke' of an Ether limit, it just felt like a distraction at the moment and not a priority.

- Bob Summerwill because he's so collaborative and so focused on bringing people together right now and does so publicly and it personally inspires me.","This is a hard question. A lot of people have said big open source projects like Linux but I don't know enough about that culture / ecosystem to comment. There are certainly things to be learned from big, old-school conglomerates and down-and-dirty listserv communities. I think that knowledge and inspiration and wisdom can often come from unexpected places.","It should embody the potential. It should be the basis, the foundation, the starting point. It shouldn't be the end or the solution, but simply the thing that enables and empowers other things to be created and others to create the things. Things like dapps and communities and things that change the world.","The idea of being able to create meaningful things that slowly change the world around us and re-distributed the power.","Probably back when it hit like $2.50. We lost our shit. We joked about being on the way to huge parties on boats. I remember it because of the price and price talk (which is ironic as fuck, but hear me out).

The attitude and atmosphere wasn't actually about the price. We didn't sell at $2.50 or even $10. It was never about the money. When ETH hit $2.50, for us at least, it was about a wider group of people realizing the potential. It was about those who were already part of the Ethereum community seeing things come together and clicking into place. The vision and our imaginations were slowing becoming reality. Geth was way more stable. Mist had launched. MEW was working well. The Ethereum StackExchange had been approved for the next stage of whatever. People were helping each other across reddit and stackexchange and were really, really eager to build. Everyone was joining the DAO slack and talking about the potential of decentralized organizations.

That is when I think I realized that the sky was the limit and we had the ability to shape the future and the world.","The DAO Slack was this thing—this almighty thing that everyone joined. There was nothing else really going on. And it generated such community and excitement. But then came the next Slack...and the next Slack....and the next. Then came the scammers. Today we have such disparate communities spread across Slack, Telegram, Discord, Riot, Reddit, etc. etc. etc. It's hard to keep track of things and be part of something. The community that formed in the early days is torn up and the existing forums (reddit) are overrun by people obsessed with the price, people trying to scam each other, etc. I feel like we've lost our values, or at least lost sharing our values with the larger world. It's disappointing to not be able to tell a tech-savvy, crypto-interested person to go to Reddit anymore. It's hard to say ""follow awesome people on twitter"" or ""find sweet communities on Telegram"" with a straight face. My favorite communities are random working groups that are goal-focused (e.g. the anti-phishing workgroup) rather than project focused. I wish more people from different communities would come together to accomplish things instead of these token/price focused communities. I understand that when you have a token and a project you want to create a community around that token/project but over time we have lost the community around Ethereum at its core.
","Price talk. Token talk. ICO talk. Scams. Unnecessary competition. Not working together better. Trolls. Going on reddit. Literally. I'm a fucking reddit moderator and opening reddit exhausts me these days. It's so sad. It used to invigorate me to talk and connect with random people but these days theres so much hate. And not hate as in questioning projects or questioning why something is or isn't a certain way, but just straight hate and ulterior motives. ","I'm not sure who ""we"" is so I'll preface this by saying that I'm interpreting this as a collective ""we""—a we that is all of those who are interested in the potential of Ethereum.

I think the biggest shift in the Ethereum community was, as is with most small communities, that a large group of people who didn't share the same values as the original set of people appeared. This second group of people quickly overran the first group of people and set the tone for what an outsider sees Ethereum as. This perpetuates indefinitely.

Interpret that as you may, based on your personal experience. The reddit mentality shifted. People appeared solely to grab cash during ICO madness. Things like that.

The first, smaller group of folks failed though. We didn't continue speaking up and being vocal and sharing our values (vocally) day in and day out. Instead, we retreated to the smaller, safer havens where we knew one another. Maybe that was random Skype groups or one-on-one conversations or simply hanging out with our own team more instead of in public on reddit. I am guilty as well and I regret not doing my part to actively set a good example for the community I wanted to see and instead chose to bitch about it (and am still bitching about it, apparently).

How do we encourage an ecosystem that is collaborative and accepting. Where new people can understand what we are trying to build and contribute with that mindset. Where they can find their own space in the ecosystem and contribute to it as well?","Someone who looks out for the bigger goals and values of the ecosystem. Someone who protects the people. Someone who doesn't let drama get to them. Someone who sees the big pictures and stays focused on it. Someone who can engage in debate—hardcore, passionate debate—without stooping to personal attacks. Someone who cares...like really fucking cares. Someone who asks the right questions. Someone who knows how little they know. Someone who empowers people around them to be the best versions of themselves. Someone who can explain things and make things understandable. Someone who has a strong moral compass. Someone who doesn't care about price or money. Someone who hugs and brings people together. Someone who has time to spend on the people around them. Someone who wants to be better each and every day. Someone who gracefully reminds us all to be our best selves.","I know nothing. Literally. Nothing.

Questioning myself and why I am a certain way.

Being brutally honest with myself and being okay with that fact I know nothing and am nothing in the grand scheme of things.

Questioning & judging myself:
Is this the best thing for Ethereum, or the best thing for my project?
Am I saying this because I’m selfish or because it’s the best thing for Ethereum?
Is this decision arbitrary?
What am I not seeing?
What am I optimizing for?
Does it really matter?
How can I prevent ____ from happening again?
Why did I not see ____ coming?
Do the people I care about and value most know that I value and care about them?","One where there are more people communicating and building together better. One where people are contributing valuable insights from their unique experiences and insights and backgrounds. One where the group as a whole is stronger than its individual parts. One where people feel empowered. One where healthy debate and questioning is encouraged.","I think that sometimes we forget that it's okay not to try to re-invent every little thing. It's okay to learn from those who came and built before us—even if that means taking advice from centralized banks or some shit. We don't have to necessarily reinvent organizational structure and the financial system and the communication tools or best practices. Sometimes it's best to disrupt one thing at a time. 😉","Feeling that I create / provide value to the people around me. Whether that's simply making someone's day better by complimenting them or empowering them to do something they didn't think they were able to do or whatever. ","Don't judge me too harshly on the above. I dumped my brain on the page and I'm not going to scroll up and revise. Also, I love you for doing this. Thank you. 💖","Taylor Monahan"

Initiatives like cryptoeconomics.study are a fantastic antidote to this, because it takes the same thoughtful considerations and transforms them into something constructive.","We are failing in our willingness to engage in public discourse about governance on the enterprise, application, and blockchain levels.

ENTERPRISE -
I've been part of a Fortune 500's efforts to evaluate blockchain adoption (public chain & otherwise) and their number one concern, which they felt was unanswered, was how governance could work.

APPLICATION -
Maybe people are fearful of aggressively experimenting with on-chain application governance after the DAO?

BLOCKCHAIN -
The EIP process, for example, is a bit mysterious to most of the community. I'd say the lack of understanding by the community was the leading reason some ""Ethereum killers"" raised so much money and attention in the last year. And I'm not even bringing this up to say I think they are a threat or whatever - diversity in implementations is a good thing. It's more to bring attention to the fact that _maybe_ if we had a more open discourse about governance, then some of the resources and mindshare that went to these other projects might have been applied to Ethereum.","An educator.","Time is our most limited resource.

Of course, there are incentives in place that will likely drive this naturally (as they have already proven they do). But it's still something I worry about.","Empowering people. I used to work with people with disabilities for a number of years, and it was immensely rewarding. Blockchain will empower more people than I could have personally helped on my own. Of course, it's a different kind of empowerment and I don't really get the same personal face-to-face exposure. But the impact is real and meaningful.

Empowering people gives my life meaning because it creates a shared experience with others. Shared experiences have the power to move entire groups of people: families, friends, organizations, societies, and even civilizations. When a group of people make a change on that scale, it has the potential to produce dramatically new understandings.

Griff Green embodies everything that is good about our community. He is just about the nicest, most generous person I have ever had the pleasure to know. He is indefatigably optimistic, open, and giving to the community he cares about passionately.

Jordi Baylina and the rest of the WHG, perhaps unsurprisingly, like Griff Green, contribute a great deal to many people in the space without looking for recognition of their work, or expectation of reward outside of the betterment of the space.","How about just one?

I think there has been an unfortunate, albeit perhaps inevitable, detour to less savoury and primarily financially motivated waters, but the real work is still being done by the best teams in the space, and they are still adhering to the values which were present in the early days.","Perversely, the theDAO fiasco springs to mind, because it brought so many of us together to overcome a common obstacle.","As a leader of a project which will do an ICO, I don't really like ICOs. I think they have a potential for being a force for good, but I feel they are a powerful tool we have not yet learned how to use responsibly. Consequently, they are being used for wildly inappropriate purposes by inappropriate projects. I feel like there are very specific cases where an ICO is appropriate, and I'd like us to get to a point where we can self regulate this. However, I don't have a good answer as to how to do so practically.","Ugh, hands down ICO marketing, and the increasing difficulty of filtering signal from noise. The corollary to this effect is that it seems the community at large now finds it harder to distinguish between meaningful thought and development, and marketing fluff, so engagement has reduced.","There are no failures, only lessons.","I kinda see the whole Ethereum community as being a weird sort of company. It's not a partnership, because we're all doing our own thing, but we have a common underlying economic layer, and if we do good things independently, in aggregate we will all benefit.

This benefit however, is not solely pecuniary, indeed it is by the proliferation of behaviours and practices which are fundamentally designed to create a better, fairer social and economic systems which have the power to displace the current imbalanced and exploitative ones.

The people I most care about in the space therefore are those who:

* Understand that their path to personal success, is the success of the wider ecosystem and always strive for information symmetry and aligned interests.
* Engage intelligently, critically, candidly, and kindly with the opportunities and challenges we face together.
* Embrace the open source ethos of sharing without expectation of direct reward.
* Are open and willing to share insights won through success and failure alike.","I believe I have the right to do whatever brings me satisfaction, on the condition that my satisfaction is not at the cost of harm to others.","I am an optimist. I believe, for the first time in history, we have at our disposal the building blocks of a post capitalism society, able to compete with and supersede capitalism, on its own terms: rational self interest. I think this gives us the tools to create fairer economic systems which do not incentivise, and inevitably lead to the concentration of disproportionate wealth with a very few, because the game theory shows us that these systems only truly work if that wealth (and control) is well distributed.","Privacy and forgiveness: the blockchain never forgets.

As a society we have almost uniformly agrees that everyone gets to be forgiven, and records expunged, for all but the most heinous of crimes. We don't have that on the blockchain, and if we can be associated with an address, our actions and errors will be plainly available to see for all time. ","Wow. Big question.

My previous career was as a ultra high end jeweller. I made extraordinarily expensive things for people who already had so much too much, they had to really go out of their way to find extravagant ways of spending money on the most utterly self indulgent and frivolous fripperies the world has to offer. Honestly, it was nauseating—especially when combined with the wholly inappropriate sense of importance, sophistication, and gravitas which these people attach to it.

That experience actually leeched meaning from my life. Although I liked making the super complex, amazing objects I made, which by virtue of their nature will probably outlive humanity, the context of that creation was so inescapably vapid, it made me sick.

By contrast, I now feel like I am working towards something which (I hope) will end up (even if in only a small way) improving the world, within a community which broadly feels like it shares my values. To me, that is far more fulfilling than being featured in Vogue for the bling I made which lives in some rich dude's safe.","I think I've said enough.","Jack du Rose"

Mihai's blog post on the ""crypto renaissance"" was the catalyst that clicked it all into place for me. I don't come from a technical or finance background, so though I knew a bit about bitcoin it was never appealing enough for me dive in to learn more (at the time I associated bitcoin with a certain type of redditor nerd/bro -- I had mildly misogynistic experiences that turned me off), but Ethereum was different. From the start it was a place I felt comfortable asking questions, was treated with respect and kindness/wasn't talked down to because I wasn't technical or was a woman, there was sort of an implicit value of feminine intelligence and qualities that made it really easy to stick around. And I'm still here because that's still the case. I'm still here because I'm challenged every day by some of the smartest people on the planet, because community members are truly driven by building a better world, and because there's a foundational thoughtfulness and evolved consciousness vibe that's not going anywhere. ","DevCon1 was definitely up there. Partially because it was a tremendous feat to pull off along with the under-resourced Foundation (myself, a handful of other ConsenSys people & volunteers) -- we barely did it. That sort of experience feels like a tangible irl experiential case study of the community strengths & values we espouse. It was also for me a starkly validating and surreal experience. This was the first time I met most of the community in person, and I think that was true for many of the attendees. It felt as though we were all pinching ourselves, there was a sense of ""shit, this is real...I'm not just awaking from a fever dream!"" with a giddy and joyous momentum that flowed from that. ","Some of the drama during Ming's tenure at the foundation was a little frightening -- but that wasn't something that was really a part of the public community (which is one of the reasons why it was bad -- the secrecy, fear, etc.). The EIP 999 noise is a bit frustrating and distracting, but I think there are enough community leaders (like yourself w/ this survey), and a general groundedness of mentality in the larger community that will result in applicable learnings and overall positivity in hindsight. ","Keeping up with the pulse! The typical ups and downs of investing your energy in a community of minimally structured emergent social behavior. Emotionally -- the weight of the broader community risks we all share (i.e. another DAO, regulatory uncertainty, etc.) are no small toll. But something I think Ethereum does well compared to other areas of crypto is we collectively understand the importance of levity, humor, self-expression, and kindness in the face of all of that. ","More something we can do much much better at --> Investing in research and tools to improve the experience of and lower the barriers to being a good community member. A ton of other things as well -- we could be better at engaging with policy makers and other sorts of extra-community outreach/advocacy, better at not allowing media narratives to warp or simplify the community (esp. wrt to the 'cult of Vitalik'), better at building developer-friendly documentation, tooling, education and outreach materials. Too many to name. ","Biased towards action; curiosity & empathy -- someone who listens, reads, and asks questions of those around them; purpose driven; sees their role as being of service to the community, ie. sharing skills and resources to improve the technology for all. ","Love, integrity, courage, collaboration, fun, intellectual rigor, loyalty, harmony, expression, justice, meritocracy, empathy, autonomy, service, generosity, fairness, beauty, and inspiring others. ","I try to envision a nice one. :) But I'm a student of history, I know it's going to get really ugly at times. The majority of people are not going to be able to handle the cognitive shifts that the acceleration of technology requires, which will lead to lots of friction, insanity, violence. But generally I'm pretty trans-humanist/singularity leaning, I envision a loving and harmonious Pierre Teilhard de Chardin-esque ""global brain"" type of future -- enabled by technology (blockchain, AI, etc.) of course. ","The best fear to have is the fear of your own ignorance and biases, of what we don't know yet (like scaling), and what we don't know we don't know. I'm also fearful of misaligned incentives and unintended outcomes of new technology (like what we've seen with social media), especially a technology that has to rely so much on human behavior as a design variable. ","I'm driven by the evolution of humanity -- catalyzing/driving/aligning/building towards that is my purpose & what gives my life meaning. My relationships give my life meaning, my own mind/internal world, my personal experience of a spiritual/energetic universal force -- all the usual stuff. :) ","Thank you for putting this out there!!!

"2018/06/03 3:25:04 PM GMT+2","I’ll also state the obvious — it’s hard to widdle it down to three. I’ll also avoid the obvious candidate, Kevin Owocki, to remove any implicit bias and to avoid having to shill Colorado (there is no explaining Kevin without explaining Colorado). Here goes.

Andy Tudhope. I have spent approximately 3 hours of my life with Andy, and that was enough to make this answer a no brainer. Those of you who know Andy will understand.

When a conversation with one person can span the gamut from philosophy, economics, linguistics, biology, and history naturally, you know you’ve come across a special person. If you have some spare time and a clear mind, his personal blog includes poems, fascinating articles, teachings from Alan Watts, and a little about this whole Ethereum thing.

Andy is clearly grounded in philosophy and values first. Then, because he senses alignment with those values — the Ethereum movement.

Dan Finlay. Dan quietly co-leads MetaMask, the 1 million+ user rails to Ethereum which somehow still feels under-appreciated in the ecosystem although it may be the number one single contribution to the growth of the dApp ecosystem.

He, like Andy, is a vociferous reader who thinks deeply about the ecosystem and the why behind Ethereum. I’ve never seen anything like his Web of Trust Map. It spatially coordinates new information about ideas and projects in the ecosystem. Though incomplete, it constantly grows and shows proof of a systemic thinker worthy of admiration.

Kames Cox-Geraghty. Many of you may not know Kames, but his energy for what is happening in the Ethereum ecosystem consistently amazes me. His work ethic, his technical understanding of the space, and his energy are all ever present. He has no ego and is always making plays for the broader ecosystem. He can be a little off-the-rocker at times, but that’s what makes Kames…Kames 🙂.

There are so many honorable mentions that it feels silly to try to do so, but I’ve had memorable interactions with Mitch Kosowski, Raul Jordan, Mark Beylin, Eva Beylin, Jonathan Sampson, Christian Jeria, John Lilic, Maurelian, Niran Babalola, Nate Rush, Sunny Aggarwal, Ashley Tyson, Richard Burton, Michael Sena and Hudson Jameson.

Perhaps more important than any of the philosophical details about Andy, Dan, Kames or the others— each is a kind, trustworthy person. While I know “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”, I feel safer going down the road knowing these people will step up and say something if they feel we’re going the wrong way.","The early days of Linux is the no brainer. The Cathedral and the Bazaar should be required reading for anyone building in an open, decentralized manner. We reflected on the key takeaways earlier this year at Gitcoin.

A less cited corollary might be Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world founded by Ray Dalio (author of Principles). Bridgewater’s cultural north star is as follows: We want an idea meritocracy in which meaningful work and meaningful relationships are pursued through radical truth and radical transparency.

The Sovereign Individual meets Radical Markets.
","Decentralization as an operating principle is often conflated with decentralization as a blockchain concept. They are different things. I return to ‘idea meritocracy’ as a better way to embody what we want as an ecosystem, while learning and growing aside each other as a community.","Originally, the shiny objects: smart contracts, programmable money, and decentralized applications, Vitalik’s genius. Then, the people, the community, the ideas, the energy. That being said, a general belief in Vitalik’s once-in-a-generation vision definitely helps keep me here.

At some level, it’s true that Ethereum’s magnetism has brought in so many smart, seemingly well-intentioned people that Vitalik is no longer a schelling point. Ethereum can continue without him. But, at another, it’s completely ludicrous to understate his impact on the community.

A big name I met once called him ‘one of the three non-linear geniuses’ he’s ever met. It should be celebrated — although I understand why it’s downplayed. It’s a huge burden to place on one human.

The community is stickiest now because of all of the other amazing work and thought bursting out the seams. Brave is an amazing browser. 0x is taking off. MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle provide rails to the ecosystem. We hope we’ve found something with Gitcoin. It’s a wild, exciting time where ideas are everywhere, and where the community is focused on building.

It’s also uncertain. It can all be lost. We must be vigilant, we must be value-driven, we must work hard. There’s an excitement in the unknown.","ETHWaterloo. I hacked on Mazi with Niko Lazaris and Matthew Siu and we stumbled into a prize winning submission. Along the way, we slept little, got feedback from great people like Jeff Coleman, Joey Krug, Mark Beylin, and Vitalik. We nerded out with hackers like Yondon Fu of Livepeer and the Cryptokitties team (hustling with Pokemon Cryptokitties at the ice cream stand!). I first met Owocki and heard about his interesting project, Gitcoin.

We enjoyed great food and hospitality from the organizing team (shoutout to Liam Horne, Kartik Talwar, and Mark Beylin, among others). And simply, I got a first taste for the open community that was being built.","The DAO was no fun, clearly. It’s okay to call it a failure. It’s also important that we have proven antifragile to the split, at least at this scale. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are still amicable communities. EIP-999, however, points to a more systemic governance question which has followed through the DAO.

EIP0 is a a step in the right direction, although I’m not convinced that ‘formalizing governance’ is the right approach. It’s with shared values that we’ll create the future. That’s why I appreciate the space to write this post.

I also believe we still have a huge capital allocation problem. The opportunity cost of sitting on capital has to be systematically evaluated. In a nutshell, this is why ConsenSys is so important — because Joe is willing to make bets and put Ethereum out there on the world stage.

The community is sitting on a war chest of funding which could be put to good use. I’m excited to see the progress Aya, jon choi, and the ECF team (Cassandra Shi, Awa Sun Yin) are making herehere. Getting developers excited about working on important infrastructure problems is the most leveraged play we can make.","More a microchasm of society than anything, but blockchain Twitter can easily turn into reality TV. I hope to spend more time on ETH Research and less on ETH Twitter in the coming months.","See answer above. ","Kind, trustworthy, and as independent as possible in their thinking.","Here are the seeds of an ever-growing list.

If everything is important, nothing is important.
Set goals, then build systems.
Self-love is the first step to all other love.
“At the end of the day, self-esteem is whether you lived up to your expectations. You’ll always know.”
Don’t say yes to everything… say no, sometimes, to follow your dreams.
We all have angels… We all have demons.
Starting things is easy, finishing things is hard.","A future where respect for borders remains, but respect for the freedom of the individual is prioritized.

If we learned from The Lessons of History, inequality always eventually reaches a breaking point where the underserved (violently) revolt against the system which oppresses them. Capitalism thus breeds socialism, and socialism eventually breeds capitalism.

An outstanding question: can overall abundance created reduce the effects of this cycle, or will human nature dictate that the oppressed still want a fair shot at more, even if Maslow’s needs are met?","Baking assumptions of rationality into complex systems built for irrational humans has not traditionally ended well.

How will the ecosystem react to inevitable future shocks?

Inertia is a strong force. Did we give too much to too few, too early? Will these people provide on ramps?

Tribalism is dangerous. I feel drawn to the Ethereum community, but would echo Vitalik from Deconomy 2018.
